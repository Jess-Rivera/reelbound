# reelbound
Slot machine roguelike set in a retro-neon casino hell.

## Overview
reelbound blends the tension of roguelike progression with the chance mechanics of classic fruit machines.  
Each “run” plays through a branching map of fights, shops, repairs, and alchemical experiments — every spin raising your **Heat** until your machine begins to mutate.
