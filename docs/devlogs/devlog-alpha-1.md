# DEVLOG 0.1.0-alpha-1

When I started this project, I was at work with a colleague (we'll call him Bobbert). It's not a software job, but our company had just rolled out some AI tools for everyone to use. Bobbert had never really touched AI before, so I showed him the basics and he got hooked fast, especially when he realized it could code. He made a small game with it—I honestly don’t remember what—but it was enough to activate the monkey-brain.

So I did what any good neurodivergent person does when they find a new obsession. I started vibe coding. The difference this time was that I didn’t want to stay in that phase forever. I’d taken a few programming classes in college, but it never really stuck. This time I decided I’d use the AI as both a coder and a teacher. The first few files were pure chaos, but as the project grew, I had to get more intentional, and that forced me to actually learn what the code was doing.

The idea itself came from a roguelike binge. Two games in particular—Clover Pit and Slay the Spire—hit me hard. Huge shoutout to those devs. But I had a few ideas of my own that I hadn’t seen before, so I decided to try making them real. Solo dev, learning as I go.

I started simple. Get a slot machine spinning. That took about two days. Then I added the round system, which took closer to five, and that’s where I really started learning. There were more moving parts, more logic to track, more ways to break everything. Do I know how to code now? Not really. Can I write a function without it breaking? Usually not. But can I read a chunk of TypeScript and understand what it’s doing? Mostly yes.

That really hit home when I ran into a logic bug where credits weren’t updating. The code looked fine, but something was off. I had to trace it back through six different functions to find the problem. Classic “you missed a semi-colon” moment. I finally get those memes now.

My goal for Alpha-1 was to get the round system running and have a clear win/defeat flow. I hit that goal. Alpha-1 is done, and it works. Time to move on to the next feature.
